# Google Sheets To Instagram Poster (Discontinued)

To briefly summarize this project, this is a discontinued Instagram post generator and posting bot. Using the Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs, it is able to fetch Google Forms Submissions (automatically stored in Google Sheets) and generate a square image to post to Instagram. The post generator automatically increments the number of the post, automatically scales the post text to best fit the caption, and then uploads the post to Google Drive (As the Instagram API requires a URL for an image post). The bot also checks for moderator approval in the form of manual checkbox filling found in the Google Sheets file. Once ready, the bot attempts to post the image with the caption to a specified Instagram Account using the Instagram Graph API. 

This bot was used mainly for one (now discontinued) Instagram account: [@tcdengineeringconfessions](https://www.instagram.com/engineeringconfessionstcd?igsh=bnpkbDQyZXR5Nmk0), for student entertainment purposes.

This project heavily relied on the corresponding Google API Documentation, Instagram Graph API with [Justin Stolpe's tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0glhsZ01I-BAFwPmQBWMNqUDnkSlOR6r&feature=shared).

This project also makes use of OpenSans Font for non-commercial & non-royalty purposes, without any modifications.
